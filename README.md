# Shell Scripting


## The Shell
The shell is the operating system's command-line interface (CLI) and interpreter for the set of commands that are used to communicate with the system.

## Shell Script
A shell script is usually created for command sequences in which a user has a need to use repeatedly in order to save time.

## Shell commands
- We create a script using the command.
```
touch myscript.sh
```
and make it executable using the command
```
chmod +x myscript.sh
```
and to run it
```
./myscript.sh
```

To check the location of the bash command 
```
which bash
```

### ECHO COMMAND
The echo command is used to print text to the screen.

```
echo "Hello World"
```
